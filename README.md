SoftWire
========

SoftWire lets you create new functions at run-time using functions and constructs which closely resemble x86 syntax, entirely within C++. Through dynamic specialization you can generate code that is more optimized for the task at hand than can be achieved through static optimization. It is suited for implementing high performance pipelined calculations such as in graphics, but can also be used as the back-end for a (JIT) compiler or for encryption purposes.
